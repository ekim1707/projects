# Exercise 1
# Draw these simple shapes (each in its own .py file):
# 
# an equilateral triangle
# a square
# a pentagon
# a hexagon
# an octagon
# a star
# a circle
# Exercise 2
# Extract all the code for the shapes in exercise 1 into functions. Move them all into a single file called shapes.py.
# Write a new .py program that imports the shapes module and use its functions to draw all the available shapes onto the
# screen.
# Exercise 3
# Add parameters into the various functions of your shapes module. Include:
# 
# size - the size of the shape
# fill - a bool specifying whether to fill or outline the shape
# color - the color of the shape. *Hint: you can use the color function to set both the pen color and the fill color.
# Make a new .py program that imports the shapes module and uses its functions to draw different shapes of various colors,
# fills, and sizes.
# Exercise 4
# Draw a night sky full of stars of various sizes. *Hint: use bgcolor function to set the background color.

# Artistic Project 1
# Draw your own house, be detailed. Break down the components of the house such as door, window, roof, porch, etc into
# individual functions.
# 
# or Artistic Project 2
# Draw an abstract design inspired by the artwork around the room. Use functions to break down the design into several
# components.
